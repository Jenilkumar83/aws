EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = IaaS

It mainly consists in the capability of :
-Renting virtual machines (EC2)
-Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
-Distributing load across machines (ELB)
-Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)

• How much compute power & cores (CPU)
• How much random-access memory (RAM)
• How much storage space:
  -Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
  -hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
• Firewall rules: security group
• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 Instance Types:
-General purpose
-Compute Optimized
-Memory Optimized
-Storage Optimized
-HPC Optimized
-Accelerated Computing
-Instance features
-Measuring instance performance

Security Group:
-Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS, they control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances
-Only contain allow rules, rules can reference by IP or by security group
-Security groups are locked down to a region/vpc combination, Can be attached to multiple instances
-All inbound traffic is blocked by default
-All outbound traffic is authorised by default

Classic Ports:
22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) – upload files into a file share
22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) – upload files using SSH
80 = HTTP – access unsecured websites
443 = HTTPS – access secured websites
3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance

Summary:
• EC2 Instance: AMI (OS) + Instance Size (CPU + RAM) + Storage + security groups + EC2 User Data
• Security Groups: Firewall attached to the EC2 instance
• EC2 User Data: Script launched at the first start of an instance
• SSH: start a terminal into our EC2 Instances (port 22)
• EC2 Instance Role: link to IAM roles
• Purchasing Options: On-Demand, Spot, Reserved (Standard + Convertible), Dedicated Host, Dedicated Instance

Which EC2 Purchasing Option can provide the biggest discount, but is not suitable for critical jobs or databases?--spot instances
A company would like to deploy a high-performance computing (HPC) application on EC2. Which EC2 instance type should it choose?--compute optimized
