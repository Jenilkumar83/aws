EC2 instance storage::

EBS(elastic block store): volume is a network drive you can attach to your instance while they run
-it allows instance to persist data, even after their termination
-they can only be mounted to one instance at a time
-they are bound to a specific availability zone

EBS Snapshots:
-Make a backup (snapshot) of your EBS volume at a point in time
-EBS Snapshot Archive, Recycle Bin for EBS Snapshots

AMI:Amazon Machine Image
-AMI are a customization of an EC2 instance
-You can launch EC2 instances from:
 1.A Public AMI: AWS provided
 2.Your own AMI
 3.An AWS Marketplace AMI: an AMI someone else made (and potentially sells)
-ami used for own soft license,own configuration,own os

EC2 Instance Store:
-EBS volumes are network drives with good but “limited” performance
-If you need a high-performance hardware disk, use EC2 Instance Store


EFS – Elastic File System:
-Managed NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on 100s of EC2
-Highly available, scalable, expensive (3x gp2), pay per use, no capacity planning

EFS Infrequent Access (EFS-IA):
-Storage class that is cost-optimized for files not accessed every day
-Enable EFS-IA with a Lifecycle Policy
-Example: move files that are not accessed for 60 days to EFS-IA

Amazon FSx:
-Launch 3rd party high-performance file systems on AWS
-Fully managed service


Summary:
• EBS volumes:
  -network drives attached to one EC2 instance at a time
  -Mapped to an Availability Zones
  -Can use EBS Snapshots for backups / transferring EBS volumes across AZ
• AMI: create ready-to-use EC2 instances with our customizations
• EC2 Image Builder : automatically build, test and distribute AMIs
• EC2 Instance Store:
  -High performance hardware disk attached to our EC2 instance
  -Lost if our instance is stopped / terminated
• EFS: network file system, can be attached to 100s of instances in a region
• EFS-IA: cost-optimized storage class for infrequent accessed files
• FSx for Windows: Network File System for Windows servers
• FSx for Lustre: High Performance Computing Linux file system
