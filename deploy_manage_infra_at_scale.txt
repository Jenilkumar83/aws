CloudFormation:
-CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining your AWS Infrastructure, for any resources

AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK):
-You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
-great for lambda , docker containers in ECS/EKS

AWS Elastic Beanstalk:
-Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
-Beanstalk = Platform as a Service (PaaS)
-Just the application code is the responsibility of the developer

Elastic Beanstalk – Health Monitoring:
-Health agent pushes metrics to CloudWatch, 
-Checks for app health, publishes health events

AWS CodeDeploy:
-We want to deploy our application automatically
-Works with EC2 Instances, Works with On-Premises Servers, Hybrid service

AWS CodeCommit:
-Before pushing the application code to servers, it needs to be stored somewhere, A famous public offering is GitHub, AWS’ competing product is CodeCommit
->CodeCommit:
• Source-control service that hosts Git-based repositories
• Makes it easy to collaborate with others on code
• The code changes are automatically versioned

AWS CodeBuild:
-Compiles source code, run tests, and produces packages that are ready to be deployed (by CodeDeploy for example)

AWS CodePipeline:
->Orchestrate the different steps to have the code automatically pushed to production
• Code -> Build -> Test -> Provision -> Deploy
• Basis for CICD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Delivery)

AWS CodeArtifact:
-Software packages depend on each other to be built (also called code dependencies), and new ones are created
-Storing and retrieving these dependencies is called ar tifact management
-Developers and CodeBuild can then retrieve dependencies straight from CodeAr tifact

AWS CodeStar:
-Unified UI to easily manage software development activities in one place

AWS Cloud9:
-AWS Cloud9 is a cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for writing, running and debugging code

AWS Systems Manager (SSM):
-EC2 and On-Premises, Hybrid
-Patching automation for enhanced compliance
-Run commands across an entire fleet of servers

Systems Manager – SSM Session Manager:
-No SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys needed
-No por t 22 needed (better security)

Summary:
• CloudFormation: (AWS only)
  -Infrastructure as Code, works with almost all of AWS resources
  -Repeat across Regions & Accounts
• Beanstalk: (AWS only)
  -Platform as a Service (PaaS), limited to certain programming languages or Docker
  -Deploy code consistently with a known architecture: ex, ALB + EC2 + RDS
• CodeDeploy (hybrid): deploy & upgrade any application onto servers
• Systems Manager (hybrid): patch, configure and run commands at scale

• CodeCommit: Store code in private git repository (version controlled)
• CodeBuild: Build & test code in AWS
• CodeDeploy: Deploy code onto servers
• CodePipeline: Orchestration of pipeline (from code to build to deploy)
• CodeAr tifact: Store software packages / dependencies on AWS
• CodeStar: Unified view for allowing developers to do CICD and code
• Cloud9: Cloud IDE (Integrated Development Environment) with collab
• AWS CDK: Define your cloud infrastructure using a programming language
