Docker:
-Docker is a software development platform to deploy apps
-Apps are packaged in containers that can be run on any OS

ECS:(Elastic Container Service):
-You must provision & maintain the infrastructure (the EC2 instances)
Fargate:
-You do not provision the infrastructure (no EC2 instances to manage) – simpler!
-serverless offering

Serverless:
-Serverless is a new paradigm in which the developers don’t have to manage servers anymore…
-They just deploy code
-Initially... Serverless == FaaS (Function as a Service)


Why AWS Lambda::
EC2:
• Virtual Servers in the Cloud
• Limited by RAM and CPU
• Continuously running
• Scaling means intervention to add / remove servers
Lambda:
• Virtual functions – no servers to manage!
• Limited by time - shor t executions
• Run on-demand
• Scaling is automated!


Batch vs Lambda::
• Lambda:
  Time limit
  Limited runtimes
  Limited temporary disk space
  Serverless
• Batch:
  No time limit
  Any runtime as long as it’s packaged as a Docker image
  Rely on EBS / instance store for disk space
  Relies on EC2 (can be managed by AWS)


Amazon Lightsail:
-Virtual servers, storage, databases, and networking
->Use cases:
  -Simple web applications (has templates for LAMP, Nginx, MEAN, Node.js…)
  -Websites (templates for WordPress, Magento, Plesk, Joomla)
  -Dev / Test environment


Summary:
• Docker : container technology to run applications
• ECS: run Docker containers on EC2 instances
• Fargate:
  -Run Docker containers without provisioning the infrastructure
  -Serverless offering (no EC2 instances)
• ECR: Private Docker Images Repository
• Batch: run batch jobs on AWS across managed EC2 instances
• Lightsail: predictable & low pricing for simple application & DB stacks


Lambda Summary:
• Lambda is Serverless, Function as a Service, seamless scaling, reactive
• Lambda Billing:
  -By the time run x by the RAM provisioned
  -By the number of invocations
• Language Suppor t: many programming languages except (arbitrary) Docker
• Invocation time: up to 15 minutes
• Use cases:
  -Create Thumbnails for images uploaded onto S3
  -Run a Serverless cron job
• API Gateway: expose Lambda functions as HTTP API
