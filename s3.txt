Amazon S3:
->Use cases:
-Backup and storage
-Disaster Recovery
-Archive
-Hybrid Cloud storage
-Application hosting
-Media hosting
-Data lakes & big data analytics
-Software delivery
-Static website

Amazon S3 - Buckets:
-Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)
-Buckets must have a globally unique name (across all regions all accounts)
-Buckets are defined at the region level

Amazon S3 - Objects:
-Objects (files) have a Key

Amazon S3 – Security:
->User-Based -- IAM Policies
->Resource-based -- Bucket Policies, Object Access Control List (ACL), Bucket Access Control List (ACL)


Amazon S3 – Static Website Hosting:
-S3 can host static websites and have them accessible on the Internet

Amazon S3 - Versioning:
-It is enabled at the bucket level
-Protect against unintended deletes (ability to restore a version)
-Easy roll back to previous version

Amazon S3 – Replication (CRR & SRR):
-Must enable Versioning in source and destination buckets
-Cross-Region Replication (CRR) -- compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
-Same-Region Replication (SRR) -- log aggregation, live replication between production and test accounts


S3 Storage Classes:
• Amazon S3 Standard - General Purpose
• Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (IA)
• Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
• Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
• Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
• Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive
• Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering

S3 Standard – General Purpose

S3 Storage Classes – Infrequent Access:
-Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
-Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)

Amazon S3 Glacier Storage Classes:
-Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
-Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
-Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive – for long term storage

S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
-Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
-There are no retrieval charges in S3 Intelligent-Tiering

AWS Snow Family:
-Highly-secure, portable devices to collect and process data at the edge, and migrate data into and out of AWS
Data migration: snowcone, snowball edge, snowmobile
Edge computing: snowcone, snowball edge

Snow Family – Edge Computing::
-Snowcone & Snowcone SSD (smaller)
-Snowball Edge – Compute Optimized
-Snowball Edge – Storage Optimized

AWS Storage Gateway:
-Bridge between on-premise data and cloud data in S3
-Hybrid storage service to allow on-premises to seamlessly use the AWS Cloud
-Use cases: disaster recovery, backup & restore, tiered storage

Types of storage gateway:
-File gateway
-Volume gateway
-Tape gateway

Summary:
• Buckets vs Objects: global unique name, tied to a region
• S3 security: IAM policy, S3 Bucket Policy (public access), S3 Encryption
• S3 Websites: host a static website on Amazon S3
• S3 Versioning: multiple versions for files, prevent accidental deletes
• S3 Replication: same-region or cross-region, must enable versioning
• S3 Storage Classes: Standard, IA, 1Z-IA, Intelligent, Glacier (Instant, Flexible, Deep)
• Snow Family: import data onto S3 through a physical device, edge computing
• OpsHub: desktop application to manage Snow Family devices
• Storage Gateway: hybrid solution to extend on-premises storage to S3
