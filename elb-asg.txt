Scalability & High Availability::

->There are two kinds of scalability:
• Vertical Scalability	-- Vertical Scalability means increasing the size of the instance
• Horizontal Scalability (= elasticity) -- Horizontal Scalability means increasing the number of instances / systems for your application

Elasticity: 
-once a system is scalable, elasticity means that there will be some “auto-scaling” so that the system can scale based on the load.This is “cloud-friendly”: pay-per-use, match demand, optimize costs

What is load balancing?
->Load balancers are servers that forward internet traffic to multiple servers (EC2 Instances) downstream.

Why use a load balancer?
-Spread load across multiple downstream instances
-Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
-Do regular health checks to your instances
-Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
-Provide SSL termination (HTTPS) for your websites
-High availability across zones

Why use an Elastic Load Balancer?
->An ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) is a managed load balancer
->4 kinds of load balancers offered by AWS:
	Application Load Balancer (HTTP / HTTPS only) – Layer 7
	Network Load Balancer (ultra-high performance, allows for TCP) – Layer 4
	Gateway Load Balancer – Layer 3
	Classic Load Balancer (retired in 2023) – Layer 4 & 7
	
Auto Scaling Groups – Scaling Strategies:
-Manual Scaling
-Dynamic Scaling -> Simple / Step Scaling, Target Tracking Scaling, Scheduled Scaling
-Predictive Scaling

Summary:
• High Availability vs Scalability (vertical and horizontal) vs Elasticity vs Agility in the Cloud
• Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)
  -Distribute traffic across backend EC2 instances, can be Multi-AZ
  -Supports health checks
  -4 types: Classic (old), Application (HTTP – L7), Network (TCP – L4), Gateway (L3)
• Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
  -Implement Elasticity for your application, across multiple AZ
  -Scale EC2 instances based on the demand on your system, replace unhealthy
  -Integrated with the ELB
  
  
Which AWS offered Load Balancer should you use to handle hundreds of thousands of connections with low latency?--NLB
Which AWS service offers easy horizontal scaling of compute capacity?--ASG
Load Balancers cannot help with back-end autoscaling. You should use Auto Scaling Groups.
