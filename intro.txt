Network: cables, routers and servers connected with each other
Router : A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.They know where to send your packets on the internet!
Switch : Takes a packet and send it to the correct server/client on your network.

Cloud computing:: is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources
- pay as you go pricing
- provision exactly the right type and size of computing
- almost instantly

private cloud: single organization
public cloud: operate by third party
hybrid cloud: some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud(mix of private & public)

Characteristic of cloud computing::
on-demand self service
broad network access
multi-tenancy and resource pooling
rapid elasticity and scalability
measured service

Types of cc:
IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service), Ex: Amazon EC2 (on AWS), GCP, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode
PaaS(Platform as a Service), Ex: Elastic Beanstalk (on AWS), Heroku, Google App Engine (GCP),Windows Azure (Microsoft)
SaaS(Software as a Service), Ex: Many AWS services (ex: Rekognition for Machine Learning), Google Apps (Gmail), Dropbox, Zoom

Managed by us:
On-premises: Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
-In IaaS -- Applications, Data, Runtime, Middleware, O/S
-In PaaS -- Applications, Data
-In SaaS -- all managed by others

Pricing of the Cloud:
-Compute
-Storage
-Data transfer OUT of the Cloud

A region is a cluster of data centers,
Each region has many availability zones
(usually 3, min is 3, max is 6)
