When we start deploying multiple applications, they will inevitably need to communicate with one another, there are two types::
1) Synchronous communications:(application to application)
2) Asynchronous / Event based:(application to queue to application)

To decouple app:
-SQS: queue model
-SNS: pub/sub model
-Kinesis: real-time data streaming model

Amazon SQS – FIFO Queue:: FIFO = First In First Out (ordering of messages in the queue)
Amazon Kinesis:: Managed service to collect, process, and analyze real-time streaming data at any scale
Amazon SNS:: What if you want to send one message to many receivers?

Summary:
• SQS:
  -Queue service in AWS
  -Multiple Producers, messages are kept up to 14 days
  -Multiple Consumers share the read and delete messages when done
  -Used to decouple applications in AWS
• SNS:
  -Notification service in AWS
  -Subscribers: Email, Lambda, SQS, HTTP, Mobile…
  -Multiple Subscribers, send all messages to all of them
  -No message retention
• Kinesis: real-time data streaming, persistence and analysis
• Amazon MQ: managed message broker for ActiveMQ and RabbitMQ in the cloud (MQTT, AMQP.. protocols)
