IP Addresses in AWS::
->IPv4 – Internet Protocol version 4 
-Public IPv4 – can be used on the Internet, 
-Private IPv4 – can be used on private network (LAN) such as internal AWS networking (e.g., 192.168.1.1)

->Elastic IP – allows you to attach a fixed public IPv4 address to EC2 instance
-Note: has ongoing cost if not attached to EC2 instance or if the EC2 instance is stopped

->IPv6 – Internet Protocol version 6 (3.4 × 10 !" Addresses)
-Every IP address is public (no private range)

VPC - Vir tual Private Cloud: private network to deploy your resources (regional resource)
Subnets allow you to partition your network inside your VPC (Availability Zone resource)

-A public subnet is a subnet that is accessible from the internet
-A private subnet is a subnet that is not accessible from the internet
-To define access to the internet and between subnets, we use Route Tables.


Internet Gateway & NAT Gateways::
-Internet Gateways helps our VPC instances connect with the internet -- Public Subnets have a route to the internet gateway.
-NAT Gateways (AWS-managed) & NAT Instances (self-managed) allow your instances in your Private Subnets to access the internet while remaining private

Network ACL & Security Groups::
NACL-A firewall which controls traffic from and to subnet, ALLOW and DENY rules, only include IP addresses
Security Groups-A firewall that controls traffic to and from an ENI / an EC2 Instance, only ALLOW rules, IP addresses and other security
groups

VPC Flow Logs:
-Capture information about IP traffic going into your interfaces: vpc flow logs, subnet flow logs, elastic network interface flow logs
-Helps to monitor & troubleshoot connectivity issues: subnets to internet, subnets to subnets, internet to subnets

VPC Peering::
-Connect two VPC, privately using AWS’ network, Make them behave as if they were in the same network
-VPC Peering connection is not transitive (must be established for each VPC that need to communicate with one another)

VPC Endpoints::
-Endpoints allow you to connect to AWS Services using a private network instead of the public www network
-VPC Endpoint Gateway: S3 & DynamoDB
-VPC Endpoint Interface: the rest

Site to Site VPN & Direct Connect:
On-premises: must use a Customer Gateway (CGW) 
AWS: must use a Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)

AWS Client VPN: goes over public network
Transit Gateway: For having transitive peering between thousands of VPC and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection

Summary:
• VPC – Virtual Private Cloud
• Subnets – Tied to an AZ, network partition of the VPC
• Internet Gateway – at the VPC level, provide Internet Access
• NAT Gateway / Instances – give internet access to private subnets
• NACL – Stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound
• Security Groups – Stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level or ENI
• VPC Peering – Connect two VPC with non overlapping IP ranges, nontransitive
• Elastic IP –fixed public IPv4, ongoing cost if not in-use

• VPC Endpoints – Provide private access to AWS Services within VPC
• PrivateLink – Privately connect to a service in a 3 rd party VPC
• VPC Flow Logs – network traffic logs
• Site to Site VPN – VPN over public internet between on-premises DC and AWS
• Client VPN – OpenVPN connection from your computer into your VPC
• Direct Connect – direct private connection to AWS
• Transit Gateway – Connect thousands of VPC and on-premises networks together
